						<h4>ITINERARY</h4>

						<h5>DAY 01 DELHI</h5>
						<p>Our representative will meet you as you EXIT the ARRIVALS TERMINAL building after which you would be transferred to your hotel.</p> 
 						<p>Upon arrival at the hotel, proceed for check­in at the hotel.</p>
 						<p>India’s capital and a major gateway to the country, contemporary Delhi is a bustling metropolis, which successfully combines in its folds ­ the ancient with the modern. Amidst the fast spiraling skyscrapers the remnants of a bygone time in the form of its many monuments stand as silent reminders to the region’s ancient legacy. The first impressions for any visitor traveling in from the airport are of a specious, garden city, tree­lined with a number of beautiful parks.</p>
						<p>Overnight at the hotel.</p>

						<h5>Day 02 DELHI - AGRA</h5>
						<p>After buffet breakfast at the hotel, you will be driven from Delhi to Agra (203 KMS/ 4.30 Hours). Upon arrival, proceed for check­in at youAgra in terms of ambiance is still associated with its Mughal period. The Mughals besides being great rulers were also great builders and they preserved their best architectural wonders for Agra and its neighborhood.</p>
						<p>In the afternoon, visit Taj Mahal (closed on Fridays)</p>
						<p>The Taj Mahal is everything that has been said about it and more. Taking 22 years and 20,000 men to build, the white marble was quarried 200 miles away and was   transported   to   the   site   by   a   fleet   of   1000 elephants. Built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as   an   expression   of   his   love   for   his   wife Mumtaz Mahal, in mid-17th century, the Taj Mahal is truly one of the wonders of the world.   Though the Taj appears to be amazingly perfect from almost any angle, it is the close­up marble inlay work, which is really   astounding.   You   will   have   ample   time   to   view   and   be   mesmerized   by   this outstanding piece of architecture.</p>
						<p>Continue to visit Agra Fort, an outstanding example of Mughal   architecture.   Agra   Fort   ­   the   seat   and   the stronghold   of   the   Mughal   Empire   under   successive generations.   This   was   the   seat   of   Mughal   rule   and administration and the present structure owes its origins to Akbar who erected the walls and gates and the first buildings on the eastern banks of Yamuna River.  Shah Jehan added the impressive quarters and the mosque while Aurangzeb added the outer ramparts.  Visit its Hall of Public Audience and its Royal Pavilions. Overnight at the hotel.</p>

						<p>After buffet breakfast at the hotel, you will be driven from Agra to Delhi (203 KMS / 4.30 hours).Upon arrival at Delhi, a representative will meet you and transfer you to the airport.</p>
