						<h3>General Information About tour</h3>
						<p>Book this tour to explore visit Agra and Jaipur from Delhi and then return to Delhi</p>
							
						<h4>ITINERARY</h4>

						<h5>DAY 01 ARRIVE DELHI BY: INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT</h5>
						<p>You will arrive at New Delhi’s International Airport. Following customs, immigration formalities and baggage collection, a representative will meet you as you EXIT the ARRIVALS TERMINAL building after which you would be transferred to your hotel.</p> 
 						<p>Upon arrival at the hotel, proceed for check­in at the hotel.</p>
 						<p>India’s capital and a major gateway to the country, contemporary Delhi is a bustling metropolis, which successfully combines in its folds ­ the ancient with the modern. Amidst the fast spiraling skyscrapers the remnants of a bygone time in the form of its many monuments stand as silent reminders to the region’s ancient legacy. The first impressions for any visitor traveling in from the airport are of a specious, garden city, tree lined with a number of beautiful parks.</p>
						<p>Overnight at the hotel.</p>

						<h5>DAY 02 DELHI</h5>
						<p>After buffet breakfast at the hotel, you will proceed for full day city tour of Old & New Delhi. You will first visit Old Delhi. The tour will begin with   a   visit   to Raj   Ghat,   a   simple   memorial   to Mahatma   Gandhi; drive   past   the Red   Fort continuing   to   the Jama   Masjid, It   is   the   largest mosque   in   India,   accommodating   up   to   25,000 worshippers at one time. Designed by Shah Jahan, this grand red sandstone and white marble mosque was said to have been built by 5,000 artisans from 1644 to 1656. The broad red sandstone steps lead up to gates to the east, north and south.</p>
						<p>After visiting Old Delhi, you will be driven to New Delhi, which reflects the legacy the British left behind. The division between New and Old Delhi is the division between the capitals of the British and the Mughals respectively. The division in the walled city and New Delhi also marks the division in the life­styles. The walled city is all tradition where one will be able to glean a past life­style in all its facets, colors and spells. New Delhi in contrast, is a city trying to live up to the best of 21st century standards. The tour to Imperial Delhi will include a visit to the Qutub Minar, the tallest stone tower in India. Qutub­ud­din Aibak started it in 1199. Pulling down 27 Hindu and Jain temples and using their columns erected the attached Quwwat­ul­Islam mosque also built by him.   The tour also includes a drive past the imposing India Gate, the Parliament building and the Rastrapathi Bhawan, the President’s residence. Continue driving to Laxmi Narayan Temple –   a   Modern   Hindu   Temple.    The   Lakshmi Narayan Temple or the Birla Temple as it is popularly known enshrines Lord Vishnu – the preserver of the Hindu Trinity. The Temple is one of the major attractions of the capital city ­ Delhi. The divine tranquility of the temple is interrupted only by the melodious kirtans that echoes in the sanctum sanctorum.  The temple enshrines almost all the deities of the Hindu Pantheon.</p>
						<p>Last but not the least you will stop at Delhi’s main shopping center in Connaught Place for Shopping.</p>
						<p>Overnight at the hotel.</p>
 
						<h5>DAY 03 DELHI – AGRA</h5>
						<p>After buffet breakfast at the hotel, you will be driven from Delhi to Agra (203 KMS/ 4.30 Hours).Upon arrival, proceed for check­in at your hotel. Agra in terms of ambiance is still associated with its Mughal period.  The Mughals besides being great rulers were also great builders and they preserved their best architectural wonders for Agra & its neighbourhood.</p>
						<p>In the afternoon, visit Taj Mahal (closed on Fridays)</p>
						<p>The Taj Mahal is everything that has been said about it and more. Taking 22 years and 20,000 men to build, the white marble was quarried 200 miles away and was transported to the site by a fleet of 1000 elephants. Built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as an expression of his love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, in mid 17th century, the Taj Mahal is truly one of the wonders of the world. Though the Taj appears to be amazingly perfect from almost any angle, it is the close­up marble inlay work, which is really astounding. You will have ample time to view and be mesmerized by this outstanding piece of architecture. Continue to visit Agra Fort, an outstanding example of Mughal architecture. Agra Fort ­ the seat and the stronghold of the Mughal Empire under successive generations. This was the seat of Mughal rule and administration and the present structure owes its origins to Akbar who erected the walls and gates and the first buildings on the eastern banks of Yamuna River.  Shah Jehan added the impressive quarters and the mosque while Aurangzeb added the outer ramparts. Visit its Hall of Public Audience and its Royal Pavilions.</p>
						<p>Overnight at the hotel.</p>
						<h5>DAY 04 AGRA – FATEHPUR SIKRI ­ JAIPUR</h5>
						<p>After buffet breakfast at hotel, you will be driven to Jaipur (235 Kms / 6 hours),  enroute visiting Fatehpur Sikri, the deserted red   sandstone   city,   built   by   the   Great Mughal Emperor Akbar as his capital and palace   in   the   late   16th   century.   It   was abandoned soon after it was built when the local wells went dry and it remains today in much the same condition that it was over 300 years ago.  It is complete with palaces and mosques and used to be a town larger than London when it was originally constructed. Now it is an extraordinary place to wander around with its buildings in near perfect condition.</p>
						<p>After your visit, continue your drive to Jaipur and upon arrival, proceed for check ­in at your hotel.</p>
						<p>Rajasthan’s kingdoms are an enduring legacy to India’s history. A land endowed with invincible forts, magnificent palaces and waves of sand dunes and serene lakes. No other region in the country assembles the many paradoxes of India, as does the desert land of Rajasthan. By far it is the most colourful region in India.</p>
						<p>Jaipur's past is never too far from hand. The city of victory, Jaipur presides over the fascinating desert state and its people: surrounded by rugged hills, each crowned by a formidable fort; and beautiful palaces, mansions and gardens dotted throughout its precincts. The palaces and forts of yesteryear that  were witness  to  royal  processions and  splendour   are  now  living  monuments, accepted quite naturally into the lifestyles of the people of the "pink city".  Except for the busy traffic of bicycles, cars and buses, little seems to have changed.  There is a timeless quality to Jaipur's bazaars and its people.   With its historical past, Jaipur revives legends of the ancient Rajputs.  The dresses of the women and the turbans of the men add colour to this fascinating city. Afternoon is free for leisure or shopping.  Jaipur is great for purchases of jewellery and clothing</p>
						<p>Overnight at the hotel</p>
						<h5>DAY 05 JAIPUR</h5>
						<p>After buffet breakfast at the hotel, you will be driven just outside Jaipur to the ancient capital of Amber  to see the fabulous Amber Fort. Maharaja Mansingh, Mughal Emperor Akbar’s most successful General, started the construction of Amber Fort in the 17th century.  Before the City Palace was constructed in Jaipur, Amber was the seat of power. The fort is  surrounded by fortified battlements and overlooks the Moat Lake. Ruins and remains are spread over the Aravalli hills and sprawling crenulated walls lattice the surrounding area. An elephant (alternatively by jeeps) will spare you the trouble of reaching up to the fortress. Once on top, stroll through the sprawling complex of courtyards and halls. Many of the rooms have delightful wall paintings, with precious   stones   and   mirrors   inlaid   in   the  walls.   Most fascinating,   perhaps,   is   the   Sheesh   Mahal   (hall   of mirrors)   where   a   single   lamplight   is   reflected   in   the many mirrors, lighting up the room. En­route to Amber you will stop and see the `Palace of Winds’, otherwise known as Hawa Mahal. It is really an elaborate facade behind which the ladies of the court used to watch the daily goings on in the street below. It is extremely intricate in its pink sandstone carving. The cool wind blows through its facade of windows and latticed screens through which the queens of the court once viewed the streets of the city.</p>
						<p>In the afternoon, you will visit the city of Jaipur. Among the highlights to be seen while touring Jaipur include the City Palace, which is an overwhelming complex of exquisite palaces, gardens and courtyards, decorative art and carved doorways. The palace museum houses collections of rare   manuscripts,   armoury,   costumes,   carpets   and   miniature   paintings.   Walk   to   the   adjacent Jantar Mantar or Astronomical Observatory made by the Maharaja of Jaipur, built in 1726 and is one of  the  five  such  astronomical  wonders built  by Sawai Jai  Singh  and makes  accurate predictions even to this day. You will also have the opportunity to wander about the local markets Return to your hotel after the sightseeing tour of Jaipur City.</p>
						<p>Return to your hotel after the sightseeing tour.</p>
						<p>Overnight at the hotel</p>
						<h5>DAY 06  JAIPUR – DELHI DEPARTURE BY: INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT</h5>
						<p>After buffet breakfast at the hotel, you will be driven from Jaipur to Delhi (260 KMS / 6 hours). Upon arrival at Delhi, a representative will meet you and transfer you to International airport to board your flight back home.</p>
